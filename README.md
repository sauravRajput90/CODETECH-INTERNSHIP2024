# PROJECT OVERVIEW 

EDA results of Online Retail Dataset
Descriptive analysis is an important first step in data analysis before going into the complex quantitative or statistical models. In the case of an online retail dataset, EDA can offer useful information on customers’ behavior, performance of products, sales data and other necessary figures.

Key Areas of Focus
Data Understanding:

Import necessary libraries: Python Pandas, Python NumPy, Python Matplotlib, Python Seaborn.
Open the dataset with the help of pandas in the form of a dataframe.
Find out the data type and dimension of the data by using df.shape, list columns of the data by using df.columns and check out the details of the data type by using df.info().
Detect the columns with missing values by using df.isnull().sum().
To get the summary of the data use df.describe() for the required dataframe.
Data Cleaning:

Impute or remove missing values; This is done in order to ensure that the dataset obtained is in a usable format and is in harmony with the requirements of the model that will be implemented later.
Tackle problematic values or any irrationalities that may prevail in the data set.
Transfer types if needed; for example, transforming a ‘date’ type to a ‘datetime’.
Univariate Analysis:

To investigate each of the individual variables a histogram, box plot, count plot, and a brief description of the selected variable will be presented.
Analyse other numerical variables and metrics (e.g., Quantity, UnitPrice, TotalAmount) using the distribution in the form of the histogram as well as standard statistic measures.
Two kinds of categorical data (Country and CustomerID) can be described by count plots and frequency tables.
Bivariate Analysis:

Generally giving insights about the associations of the different variables in the dataframe using scatter plots, correlation matrices as well as group by operations.
Summarize the interaction of two numerical variables (e.g., scatterplot for the quantity and total amount).
Examine how categorical variables are related to the numerical variables, for instance, the average quantity by country.

If the dataset contains date, check the sales characteristics over time using line graphs and time series analysis.
Potential Insights
Customer Segmentation: Examine various strategic customer groups considering the customer’s buying habits.
Product Performance: Study mvp goods and skus, and product types.
Sales Trends: Categorize data based on monthly, weekly, daily and global and local trends involved, such as gaining an insight into popular times of the year for buying products and the sales growth factor.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV): It also shows a method to calculate the CLTV to discover the customer’s worth.
Geographic Analysis: This will help to know the sales pattern by region or country.
Visualization Tools
Seaborn: To meet the cooperative advertising need of creating beautiful statistical graphics.
Matplotlib: More for the plots and more control of them.
Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
